# KG-Rating

Hi, this application serves a great utility for developers from server named kongragate.com, including hourly stats and graphs.
This application is a graduation work and it's based on a custom framework developed by students, started on March 2015.

KG-Ratign uses a public "API" (request) on kongregate server, when every hour collecting an actual data of selected game and this data stores in our database.

Now, application is in "freeze" mode - not developed. If will be any interest of the application, I will develop it further.
