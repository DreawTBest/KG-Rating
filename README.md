# KG-Rating

Hi, this application serves a great utility for developers from server named kongregate.com, including hourly stats and graphs.
This application is a graduation work and it's based on a custom framework developed by students, started on March 2015.

KG-Rating is using a public "API" (request) on Kongregate's server, which is collecting an actual data of selected game every hour and storing them in our database.

The application is currently in "freeze" mode - not developed. If there is any interest about this application, I will develop it further.
